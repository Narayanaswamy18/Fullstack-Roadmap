        Node.js is a powerful, open-source runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side. <br>Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, it enables high-performance, scalable network applications through its non-blocking, event-driven architecture. <br>Node.js is particularly well-suited for building real-time applications like chat systems and online gaming due to its ability to handle multiple connections simultaneously. <br>The extensive npm (Node Package Manager) ecosystem provides a vast array of libraries and tools, streamlining development and fostering a vibrant community. <br>Its asynchronous programming model facilitates efficient handling of I/O operations, making it a popular choice for modern web development.
