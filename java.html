        Java is a versatile, high-level programming language that follows the object-oriented paradigm. <br>It was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and is now owned by Oracle. <br>Java is platform-independent, meaning programs written in Java can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it a popular choice for cross-platform applications.<br> It is widely used in web development, mobile apps (particularly Android), enterprise software, and large systems. <br>Java's strong memory management, security features, and robustness make it a reliable language for many large-scale projects.
