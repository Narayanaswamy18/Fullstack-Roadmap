        Frameworks are pre-built structures or platforms that provide a foundation for developing software applications. <br>They offer reusable code, libraries, and tools, streamlining the development process by addressing common tasks and reducing redundancy. <br>By using frameworks, developers can focus more on the unique aspects of their projects rather than reinventing basic features. <br>Popular frameworks, such as React for web development or Django for backend services, promote consistency and scalability. <br>Overall, frameworks enhance productivity, encourage best practices, and improve the efficiency of software development.
