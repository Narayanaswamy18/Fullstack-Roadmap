        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages.<br>
        It uses tags to structure content, such as text, images, links, and other multimedia.<br>
        HTML documents consist of a series of elements, where each element is defined by an opening tag (<tag>) and a closing tag (</tag>), 
        with the content in between.
