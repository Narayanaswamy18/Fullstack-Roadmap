        Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. <br>Its robust features include an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system for managing database interactions, a built-in admin interface for easy content management, and a scalable architecture that supports large applications. <br>Django follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, providing a wide range of tools and libraries out-of-the-box. <br>Its emphasis on reusability and "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) principles helps developers build maintainable and efficient codebases. <br>With strong security features and a large community, Django remains a popular choice for building web applications.
