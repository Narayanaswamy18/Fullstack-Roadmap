        Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework designed to simplify the development of responsive and mobile-first websites. 
        <br>It provides a collection of pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components such as navigation bars, forms, buttons, modals, and grids, which help streamline the design and coding process. 
        <br>One of its key features is a responsive grid system that adjusts content layout based on screen size, making it highly adaptable to various devices like desktops, tablets, and smartphones. 
        <br>Bootstrap also offers customizable themes and a wide range of built-in components, allowing developers to maintain a consistent look across their projects. 
        <br>Additionally, its extensive documentation and strong community support make it easy to learn and implement, even for beginners. 
        <br>Developers can also extend Bootstrapâ€™s functionality using plugins and third-party tools. 
        <br>Cross-browser compatibility ensures that websites built with Bootstrap work seamlessly across major browsers. 
        <br>Over time, Bootstrap has become a widely adopted framework due to its efficiency and flexibility. 
        <br>It is commonly used for both small projects and large-scale web applications, enhancing development speed and performance.
